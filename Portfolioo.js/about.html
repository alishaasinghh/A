        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2><br> <br>
        <h4>Hi, I'm Alisha Singh!
            I am a learner with a passion for web development. Currently, I am exploring HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build engaging and interactive websites. I enjoy solving problems, being creative with design, and continuously improving my skills.
            
            Beyond coding, I love [mention hobbies like music, art, writing, or sports], which help me stay inspired and think outside the box. I am always eager to learn new things and take on challenges that push me to grow.
            
            Looking forward to creating amazing projects and enhancing my knowledge every day!</h4>
